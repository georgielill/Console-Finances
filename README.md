# Financial Analysis Project
This JavaScript project analyses a dataset containing financial records, specifically the Profit/Losses for each month over a given period. The project calculates and provides insights into key financial metrics.

The script calculates and displays the following financial metrics:

<li>Total number of months in the dataset</li>
<li>Total Profit/Loss over the entire period</li>
<li>Average change in Profit/Loss month-to-month</li>
<li>Greatest increase in Profit/Loss (with the corresponding month and amount)</li>
<li>Greatest decrease in Profit/Loss (with the corresponding month and amount)</li>
<br>
You can view the calculated financial metrics in the console.
