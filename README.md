# Financial Analysis Project
This JavaScript project analyses a dataset containing financial records, specifically the Profit/Losses for each month over a given period. The project calculates and provides insights into key financial metrics.

The script calculates and displays the following financial metrics:

Total number of months in the dataset
Total Profit/Loss over the entire period
Average change in Profit/Loss month-to-month
Greatest increase in Profit/Loss (with the corresponding month and amount)
Greatest decrease in Profit/Loss (with the corresponding month and amount)

You can view the calculated financial metrics in the console.
